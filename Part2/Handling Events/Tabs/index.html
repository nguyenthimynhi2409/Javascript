    <h1>Tabs</h1>
    <div class="exercise">Tabbed panels are widely used in user interfaces. They allow you to select an
      interface panel by choosing from a number of tabs “sticking out” above an element.<br>
      In this exercise you must implement a simple tabbed interface. Write a function, asTabs, that takes 
      a DOM node and creates a tabbed interface showing the child elements of that node. It should insert a list of &lt; button &gt;
      elements at the top of the node, one for each child element, containing text retrieved from the data-tabname attribute of the child. 
      All but one of the original children should be hidden (given a display style of none). The currently
      visible node can be selected by clicking the buttons.<br> When that works, extend it to style the button for the 
      currently selected tab differently so that it is obvious which tab is selected.
