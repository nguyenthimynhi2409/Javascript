      <div class="exercise">
        In JavaScript’s early days, which was the high time of gaudy home pages
        with lots of animated images, people came up with some truly inspiring
        ways to use the language.<br />
        One of these was the mouse trail—a series of elements that would follow
        the mouse pointer as you moved it across the page. In this exercise, I
        want you to implement a mouse trail. Use absolutely positioned &lt; div
        &gt; elements with a fixed size and background color (refer to the code
        in “Mouse Clicks” on page 253 for an example). Create a bunch of such
        elements and, when the mouse moves, display them in the wake of the
        mouse pointer.<br />
        There are various possible approaches here. You can make your solution
        as simple or as complex as you want. A simple solution to start with is
        to keep a fixed number of trail elements and cycle through them, moving
        the next one to the mouse’s current position every time a "mousemove"
        event occurs.
